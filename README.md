# Go Concurrent-Safe Data Structures
This project implements various data structures and algorithms in Go. Since Go has limited built-in support for data structure operations, the API is inspired by Rust's collections and iterator trait APIs.Additionally, many of Go's built-in data structures are not inherently thread-safe, so I've included a mutex in each data structure to ensure concurrent safety.
